                  HCI scaling is one of the key metric that customers adopting the solution are looking for, unlike traditional storage where typically the infrastructure team spends huge amount of time
	                in planning and sizing the solution for capacity and performance for 3 – 5 years, with HCI this not the case. Customers can start with as small as 2-3 commodity x86 servers and scale vertically
	                or horizontally or both depending upon the solutions they adopt. Also, it is always wise to start small and then scale over the period of time, since x86 hardware innovation cycles are shorter 
	                and customer want have latest gears running in their data center. Each parameter is awarded with 1 point. <br>

                  Since the core of HCI is software which runs on commodity x86 hardware, HCI software licensing is very crucial when choosing any HCI solution. At end any customer wants is save cost, 
                  The approach for this is based on how licenses from the HCI vendors are flexible and what choices of licensing are available, needless to say in a transperant way.

                  The need for consistent security for workloads running on HCI is critical in rapidly changing environment. Almost 80% of the traffic never leaves the data center.
                  While it is critical to give greater attention to the perimeter traffice, customers have realized the importance of security for traffic that are within datacenter, 
                  this is because of the increasing number of attack that are initiated from with in datacenter. Here are the critical Micro-Segmentation parameters, each awarded with 1 point.  <br>

                  This is more of a strategy than a feature by HCI vendors. Also primarily used against competition as RFP points during tender process. 
                  Customers adopt this strategy to avoid vendor lock-in from hypervisor point of view. While this approach may want to keep hypervisor vendor in check.
                  In real world this capability adds complexities rather than efficiency in data center from manageability and operational front. 
                  More importantly the HCI vendors supporting this capability will not be able to provide the same level of features and functions as, 
                  they would offer with their own hypervisors (ex. Micro-Segmentation for other hypervisor). In this current version of the tool,

                  This parameter is the crucial for any HCI solution, in fact almost all HCI story began and revolves around storage as the core area to address. HCI as a solution started with
                  solving pain points around storage and then gradually moving towards other core components of data center. I have used multiple pointers and respective points were granted. 
                  In the below list of parameters each parameter is awarded with 1 point. <br>
                  <ol>
                      <li>Ease of installing software defined storage service</li>
                      <li>Ease of operation, efforts involved in using storage service, creating datastore, using them </li>
                      <li>Storage services offered (iSCSI, SMB, NFS, CIFS) - I personally feel these services are taking us back to traditional storage management</li>
                      <li>Ability to provide Quality of Service to a smallest storage unit possible in a VM workload</li>
                      <li>Maximum number of Nodes supported, scalability of the solution - min 32 nodes</li>
                      <li>Space optimization features, support for software dedupe, compression, erasure coding</li>
                      <li>Security – Does the solution support encryption</li>
                      <li>Replication as native feature included as part of the solution</li>
                      <li>Native file level backup / recovery support</li>
                      <li>Integrate with existing storage solution SAN, NAS</li>
                      <li>Provision capacity for non-virtualized solution eg. physical environment</li>
                      <li>Storage services overhead and requirement of dedicated resource requirements (minus points) </li>
                      <li>Integration with 3rd party backup, replication solutions</li>
                      <li>Hardware agnostic while delivering HCI capabilities</li>
                      <li>Support for both hybrid / all flash storage</li>
                  </ol>

                  Software Defined Network has caught up into data center recently. Any HCI solution without SDN is incomplete. There are HCI vendors currently offering
                  a subset or a single function of SDN. This parameter has datapoints for critical or core SDN functions which any HCI solution should have.

                  This parameter is predominantly virtual infrastructure/hypervisor feature comparison around efficient usage of x86 hardware. In the current verison of WoHCI application 
                  I measure below data points from manageability and availability of the Virtual infrastructure as a whole. So, in SDC I would measure capability to take care of planned, 
                  unplanned  downtimes. Apart from that I have also included managing resources in a dynamic way and the impact when handling the resources. Each data point awarded with one point <br>
