      <p>     World of HCI (worldofhci.com) is a web application focusing around comparing various Hyper-Converged Infrastructure solutions. WoHCI application can be used as input to while deciding on a HCI solution. </p> 
      <p>     My name is Ravikumar Govindaraj (Ravi), working with VMware as Staff Systems Engineer in Storage and Availability Business unit (SABU). I am responsible for evangelizing Hyper-converged solutions and increase market share in my region. I occasionally blog, but my core interest is around modern application architecture, storage techonologies and developing application that are useful for customers, partners, colleagues and my company.
              I strongly believe in “Knowledge is Power, only when Shared and Applied” and I try to follow the same.
